                <h3>Change is difficult. It can bring disruption, confusion and instability. However, change also brings rewards, even when hidden in struggle.</h3>

                <p>Shield Security embraces change pro-actively. We continually introduce new support, management, processes and skill sets that 
                    reward customers.Shield Security culture promotes job satisfaction and self-fulfillment for all employees.</p>

                <p>Trust and confidence are built on openness, and in turn, help create more openness. Shield Security visibly and consciously promotes 
                    penness.We have trust and confidence in our subordinates, peers and superiors. Expressing feelings, admitting problems, seeking help, inviting 
                    critique and feedback,offering ideas and suggestions, and giving support are the signs of trust and confidence.</p>

                <h3>Shield Security Actively Promotes A Climate Where Employees Act Positively and Vigorously, Rather Than Fearfully.</h3>
            <p>With the freedom to act comes Responsibility for end results. Shield Security is a results-oriented environment where people are measured on what they do and 
               how they do it. Employees welcome measurement of their contributions. It provides an opportunity to demonstrate their worth and improve on their 
               performance.</p>

            <p> A culture that allows for diversity, disagreement and dissent also ensures needed self-correction and nurtures the development of employees and 
               ideas. Employees must feel free to challenge traditional ways of doing things and to confront issues and persons directly. We expect to encounter 
               differences, but will search for the best solutions. In other words, we agree to Disagree, without being disagreeable.</p>

                <h3>Employees Must Feel They are Growing as Individuals</h3>
                <p>Good, talented men and women will not otherwise continue to grow or stay with our organization. Each Shield Security manager has the responsibility
                    to ensure every Employee in his or her area is Developing new skills and expertise. This personal and professional growth is founded on opportunity,
                    encouragement and feedback.</p>
                <p>Recognizing each employee within Shield Security brings with himself or herself unique abilities and perceptions. We encourage new ideas and give 
                    recognition to those who bring them to light. Additionally, we do not forget those who serve faithfully and dependably every day in carrying out 
                    their assigned duties.</p>
                <p>Shield Security rewards and develops technical and interpersonal competence -the ability to work effectively with others. In addition to rewarding
                    the high achiever, Shield Security also cultivates Competence by encouraging risk taking and tolerating error as important steps in the learning 
                    process. An important Shield Security process step is providing clear, valid feedback on performance.</p>
                <p>Most employees want a sense of belonging. They are honest, trustworthy, and hard working. They want to achieve significantly, and be praised and 
                    rewarded appropriately. Shield Security builds Team unity and a sense of purpose in the work unit. This allows employees to be involved 
                    meaningfully in their work. The greater the employees involvement, the greater the intensity of effort and thought applied to team roles and 
                    tasks.</p>
