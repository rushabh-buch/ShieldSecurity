                <p>Shield remains true to the statement; “Our officers are as good as their training”. We 
                    have found that with comprehensive training and support, an officer’s ability to 
                    perform at optimal levels is increased tenfold.</p>
                <p>Shield Security prides itself on our comprehensive tailored hiring and training 
                    practices. Every employee goes through a rigorous background search both criminal and 
                    personal before being considered for employment. After eligibility has been determined 
                    the potential employee is matched with a location and then begins a thorough training 
                    program individually formulated for that location.</p>

                    <h3>Supervision</h3>
                    <p>Experienced operation managers are the back bone of our organization. These 
                        individuals match an officer with a particular client. The dedication and 
                        professionalism displayed by our operation managers is second to none. They have 
                        been responsible for not only one of the highest client retention rates in the 
                        industry, but acquiring new clients through referrals.</p>
                    <p>Our operations managers are at their client’s disposal 24/7, 7 days a week. They 
                        actually partner with their client’s to achieve the most cost efficient security 
                        program for the organization’s needs. Supervision and support are key to 
                        implementing and insuring the success of any security program. We have found that 
                        by insisting on our supervisor’s high visibility and involvement with the officers, 
                        performance levels are at a much higher level than when an officer is left to their 
                        own accord.</p>
                    <p>Shield operates a 24 hour command center. This enables a central command to handle 
                        any issues that may arise day or night. Having qualified individuals at the helm 
                        of this crucial nerve center has proved invaluable in dealing with the unexpected.
                    </p>
                    <p>24 hour road supervision has been a preeminent factor in our success. Human nature 
                        prevails, through the use of staggering schedules of road supervision; we have 
                        maintained an officer performance level unseen in the security industry.</p>

                    <h3>Hiring Practices</h3>
                    <p>Shield’s stringent hiring criteria have been very successful with distinguishing 
                        high quality officers from less than desirable individuals. Our clients deserve 
                        nothing less. Some of the methods we use are:</p>
                    <ul class="ul">
                        <li>Appropriate State Background Check-applicants with prior misdemeanors, felonies, or active warrants are not considered for employment.</li>
                        <li>Applicant’s fingerprints are sent to the FBI for further clearance utilizing the new Identix process for quick results in 3-5 days.</li>
                        <li>Prudential employees participate in a screening program administered prior to employment, and randomly thereafter. We utilize a comprehensive 10 panel screen system</li>
                        <li>Former employment references</li>
                        <li>Personal references (10 years)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Employee Retention</h3>
                    <p>Maintaining high quality staff with a low turnover rate is essential to any 
                        security operation. Our philosophy of partnering and building long term 
                        relationships would be impossible if our clients had a new “partner” every other 
                        week.</p>
                    <p>Shield Security, prides ourselves on our employees, after all without them who are we. 
                        In our understanding of this we offer a wide array of the services, tools and benefits 
                        our employees need to be the best in the game. From motivating managers, high tech tools, 
                        superior training, health and vacation benefits: these all work to keep our employees 
                        happy, healthy and secure in themselves to do the best job possible for you, our 
                        customer.</p>
                    <p>Merit raises and incentives have been crucial in our retention of quality officers. 
                        By bucking the industry trend of elimination of benefits and lower pay rates, 
                        Shield has been able to retain some of the areas foremost individuals.</p>
